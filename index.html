      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p class="padding-10">A recurring dream troubles <strong>Santiago</strong>&#x002C a young and adventurous Andalusian shepherd. He has the dream every time he sleeps under a sycamore tree that grows out of the ruins of a church. During the dream&#x002C a child tells him to seek treasure at the foot of the Egyptian pyramids. Santiago consults a gypsy woman to interpret the dream&#x002C and to his surprise she tells him to go to Egypt. A strange&#x002C magical old man named <strong>Melchizedek</strong>&#x002C who claims to be the King of Salem&#x002C echoes the gypsy’s advice and tells Santiago that it is his Personal Legend to journey to the pyramids. Melchizedek convinces Santiago to sell his flock and set off to Tangier. When Santiago arrives in Tangier&#x002C a thief robs him&#x002C forcing him to find work with a local <strong>crystal merchant</strong>. The conservative and kindly merchant teaches Santiago several lessons&#x002C and Santiago encourages the merchant to take risks with his business. The risks pay off&#x002C and Santiago becomes a rich man in just a year.</p>
      <p class="padding-10">Santiago decides to cash in his earnings and continue pursuing his Personal Legend: to find treasure at the pyramids. He joins a caravan crossing the Sahara desert toward Egypt and meets an Englishman who is studying to become an alchemist. He learns a lot from <strong>the Englishman</strong> during the journey. For one&#x002C he learns that the secret of alchemy is written on a stone called the Emerald Tablet. The ultimate creation of alchemy is the Master Work&#x002C which consists of a solid called the Philosophers' Stone that can turn lead to gold&#x002C and a liquid called the Elixir of Life that can cure all ills. Santiago learns the Englishman is traveling with the caravan to the Saharan oasis of Al-Fayoum&#x002C where a powerful&#x002C 200-year-old <strong>alchemist</strong> resides. The Englishman plans to ask the alchemist the secret of his trade.</p>
      <p class="padding-10">As it turns out&#x002C the caravan must make an extended stop in Al-Fayoum in order to avoid increasingly violent tribal wars taking place in the desert. There&#x002C Santiago falls in love with <strong>Fatima</strong>&#x002C who lives at the oasis. During a walk in the desert&#x002C Santiago witnesses an omen that portends an attack on the historically neutral oasis. He warns the tribal chieftains of the attack&#x002C and as a result&#x002C Al-Fayoum successfully defends itself against the assault. The alchemist gets word of Santiago’s vision and invites Santiago on a trip into the desert&#x002C during which he teaches Santiago about the importance of listening to his heart and pursuing his Personal Legend. He convinces Santiago to leave Fatima and the caravan for the time to finish his journey to the pyramids&#x002C and he offers to accompany Santiago on the next leg of his trip.</p>
      <p class="padding-10">While the alchemist and Santiago continue through the desert&#x002C the alchemist shares much of his wisdom about the Soul of the World. They are mere days away from the pyramids when a tribe of Arab soldiers captures them. In exchange for his life and the life of Santiago&#x002C the alchemist hands over to the tribe all of Santiago’s money and tells the soldiers that Santiago is a powerful alchemist who will turn into wind within three days. Santiago feels alarmed because he has no idea how to turn into the wind&#x002C and over the next three days he contemplates the desert. On the third day&#x002C he communicates with the wind and the sun and coaxes them to help him create a tremendous sandstorm. He prays to the Hand That Wrote All&#x002C and at the height of the storm he disappears. He reappears on the other side of the camp&#x002C and the tribesmen&#x002C awed by the power of the storm and by Santiago’s ability&#x002C let him and the alchemist go free.</p>
      <p class="padding-10">The alchemist continues to travel with Santiago as far as a Coptic monastery several hours from the pyramids. There&#x002C he demonstrates to Santiago his ability to turn lead into gold using the Philosopher’s Stone. He gives Santiago gold and sends him off. Santiago begins digging for the treasure at the foot of the pyramids&#x002C but two men accost him and beat him. When Santiago speaks to them about his dream vision&#x002C they decide he must have no money and let him live. Before leaving&#x002C one of the men tries to illustrate the worthlessness of dreams by telling Santiago about his own dream. It concerns a treasure buried in an abandoned church in Spain where a sycamore tree grows. The church is the same one in which Santiago had his original dream&#x002C and he finally understands where his treasure is. He returns to Spain to find a chest of jewels and gold buried under the tree&#x002C and plans to return with it to Al-Fayoum&#x002C where he will reunite with Fatima&#x002C who awaits him.</p>
