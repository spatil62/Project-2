    <p>One of the unique things about the Indian culture is that it promotes family bonds. Unlike other societies, Indians live in a joint family structure where you can find three generations living under one roof.Different from other cultures where one gets married and starts a new life with their wife/husband away from the family, in India, the couple lives together with their in-laws.In the Indian culture, family plays an important role in their lives and most of them live in nuclear families.</p>
    <h4>The Himalayas</h4>
