          One of the unique things about the Indian culture is that it promotes family bonds. Unlike other societies&#x002C Indians live in a joint family structure where you can find three generations living under one roof.Different from other cultures where one gets married and starts a new life with their wife/husband away from the family&#x002C in India&#x002C the couple lives together with their in-laws.In the Indian culture&#x002C family plays an important role in their lives and most of them live in nuclear families.Indian society is collectivistic and promotes social cohesion and interdependence. The traditional Indian joint family&#x002C which follows the same principles of collectivism&#x002C has proved itself to be an excellent resource for the care of the mentally ill. However&#x002C the society is changing with one of the most significant alterations being the disintegration of the joint family and the rise of nuclear and extended family system. Although even in today's changed scenario&#x002C the family forms a resource for mental health that the country cannot neglect&#x002C yet utilization of family in management of mental disorders is minimal. Family focused psychotherapeutic interventions might be the right tool for greater involvement of families in management of their mentally ill and it may pave the path for a deeper community focused treatment in mental disorders. This paper elaborates the features of Indian family systems in the light of the Asian collectivistic culture that are pertinent in psychotherapy. Authors evaluate the scope and effectiveness of family focused psychotherapy for mental disorders in India&#x002C and debate the issues and concerns faced in the practice of family therapy in India.
